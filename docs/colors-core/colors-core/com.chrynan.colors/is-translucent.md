# isTranslucent

[common]\
val [Color](-color/index.md).[isTranslucent](is-translucent.md): [Boolean](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-boolean/index.html)

Determines whether this [Color](-color/index.md) is translucent, meaning that it has a [Color.alpha](-color/alpha.md) value between, but not including, 0.0f and 1.0f.

**Note:** Translucent is different than transparent. Translucency means that the alpha value is not completely opaque or completely transparent. Transparency means that the alpha value is 0.0f, or completely invisible.
